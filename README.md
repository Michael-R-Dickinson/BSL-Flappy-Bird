# Flappy Bird in BSL

Flappy bird built in Beginner Student Language.

This was intended to practice and familiarize myself with BSL's syntax and functional design principles.
It is still unfinished but contains the key features I wanted to build, such as randomly generated pipes, collision detection and bird physics as well as some basic sprites.
